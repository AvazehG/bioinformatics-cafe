## Download fastq files from BaseSpace programmatically

For usage and examples see `BaseSpaceDownloader.R -h`.

## TODO

* Check downloaded file size match size reported by BaseSpace
* If a file with the same name and size exists in the output dir, do not re-dowload it. Add a `--force` option to download anyway.
